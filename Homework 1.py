# 14. You and your partner have been assigned to a project to write a program to calculate the amount of runoff rain on a roof from any given rainfall.  
# 
# You and your partner have figured out that to calculate the runoff from any given rainfall. 
# 
# You need to take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and <b>convert them to inches</b> (ex - a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). The dimensions should be user submitted. 
# 
# Then, multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. As an example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water for an inch of rainfall. Finally, divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches; 144,000/231 = 623.38).
# 
# Your partner started coding before getting sick and it is up to you to finish the program.

# In[ ]:


print("\nRainfall Calculation ***\n")

width = int("What's roof's width in foot? ")
length = int("What's roof's length in foot? ")
rain = int("How much did it rain? ")


area = width x length x rain
